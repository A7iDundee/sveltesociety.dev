# How to contribute

It is important to keep a good workflow while developing the Svelte Society Site, for this we have established a simple, but common, workflow based on two main branches:

- **master**: this is the branch that is currently live on the [website](https://sveltesociety.dev)
- **staging**: this the working branch and can be previewed [here](https://staging.sveltesociety.dev)

As this is a community driven project, contributions are always welcome :100: but make sure to follow these guidelines so everyone's life is easier

1) Make your changes on the `staging` branch, this will make processing PRs a lot easier
2) Create a PR, detailing the changes you made and why (preferably linked to an open issue)
3) Be patient as we're also doing this on our free time :slightly_smiling_face:
